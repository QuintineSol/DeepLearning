## How to run the code
1. **Clone the GitHub Repository**: First, you need to clone the GitHub repository containing the Jupyter notebook to your local machine. You can do this using the Git command line or a GUI tool like GitHub Desktop. For example:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. **Open the Repository in Visual Studio Code**: Open Visual Studio Code and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.

3. **Install Jupyter and Required Dependencies**: Make sure you have Jupyter installed in your Python environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install jupyter
   ```
   Additionally, ensure that you have any other dependencies required by the notebook installed. You can usually find these listed in a `requirements.txt` file or within the notebook itself.

4. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: In Visual Studio Code, you can open the Jupyter notebook directly from the file explorer. Navigate to the `.ipynb` file you want to run and double-click on it to open it.

5. **Run the Notebook**: Once the notebook is open, you can run individual cells or the entire notebook. You can use the "Run Cell" button, keyboard shortcuts (usually Shift+Enter to run a cell), or use the "Run All" command from the menu to execute all cells.

6. **Setting Up Kernel**: Ensure that the kernel for the notebook is set up correctly. If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated, and the kernel is installed. You can check and change the kernel from the kernel dropdown in the notebook toolbar.

7. **Interact with the Notebook**: Once the notebook is running, you can interact with it just like any other Jupyter notebook. You can modify code, add new cells, visualize data, etc.

By following these steps, you should be able to run a Jupyter notebook in this GitHub repository in Visual Studio Code or any other coding environment that supports Jupyter notebooks.
